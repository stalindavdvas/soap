# SOAP Web Service Project in Ruby

This project demonstrates how to create and interact with a SOAP web service using Ruby. It includes both the server (SOAP service) and client (SOAP consumer) components, which communicate over SOAP-based web services.

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 3.x)
- Bundler
- Required Gems (defined in the `Gemfile`)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soap-ruby-project.git
cd soap-ruby-project
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the required gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

This will install dependencies such as `savon` and `nokogiri` that are necessary for SOAP communication.

## Usage

### SOAP Web Service Server

To start the SOAP web service server, run:

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

The server will be available on the specified port (usually `8080`), and it will listen for SOAP requests.

### SOAP Web Service Client

To interact with the SOAP service using the client, you can run the following command:

```bash
ruby client.rb
```

The client will send a SOAP request to the server, receive a response, and display the result.

### Example SOAP Request

Here’s an example of a SOAP request made by the client:

```ruby
client = Savon.client(wsdl: "http://localhost:8080?wsdl")
response = client.call(:your_method, message: { param1: "value", param2: "value" })
puts response.body
```

This will send a request to the server and print the response body.

### Dependencies

- `savon`: A Ruby gem for consuming SOAP web services.
- `nokogiri`: A gem for XML parsing and generation.
- `soap4r` (optional, based on your configuration): A Ruby SOAP toolkit.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue: Unable to connect to the SOAP service**
    - Ensure that the SOAP server is running. Check if the server is started by running `ruby server.rb`.
  
- **Issue: WSDL not found**
    - Make sure that the `wsdl` URL is correct and the SOAP service is running on the expected port.
